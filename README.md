# Advent of Code 2019

I worked on Advent of Code in 2018 and did most of the days. I had a few days where I was out of town and it became really hard to catch up. This year, I'm trying to get some simple "new day" script in to help me get a basic python script setup to read from input files, since I used that almost every day.

My goal is to get each day done this year.
